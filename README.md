# ME134
This repository contains all the code and video links to the projects completed in Matthew Woodward's Robotics Class during the Fall '21 semester. The main software and hardware used for this class include:

- Raspberry Pi & Pi Camera
- ESP something
- Arduino/C++
- Python 
- Sensors (LiDAR, Ultrasonic, Touch)
- ROS

## Projects overview 

#### Retro Clock: An Analog Clock
An analog clock that tells time (hour, minute, seconds) given a main design constraint of using 180° servo motors. Three 180° servos drive three displays showing the hour, minute, and second, all encased in 3d printed and laser cut enclosures. 
- Raspberry Pi 0 + 3 Servo Motors
- Integrated hardware + software system 

#### Assistive Technology for T-Rexes: An Initial Writing Robotic Arm
A 3 DoF robotic arm that can draw a user's intials in real time through a Raspberry Pi touch screen input. 
- Raspberry Pi 4 + Servo Hat + Touch Screen
- Forward Kinematics & DH Convention

#### Hobbes on the Go! A PID Controlled Balancing Robot 
A mechatronic puppet riding a PID controlled hoverboard, all simulated in ROS.
- Raspberry Pi 4, ESP, LiDAR, IMU
- ROS & PID Control

#### PacBot: A HRI Ball Playing Robot 
A robot that uses image processing (facial tracking and gesture recognition) to play ball with multiple users.
- Raspberry Pi 4 & Pi Camera
- Ultrasonic & Limit Switch Sensors
- Haar Cascade Facial Tracking + OpenCV Gesture Recognition

Course description: Broad review of theoretical and applied aspects of robotic manipulators and mobile robots.  Statics, kinematics, dynamics, actuation, sensing, sensor fusion, trajectory planning and control with hands-on applications.  Pre-requisites: ME 0035 or graduate standing or permission of instructor.
